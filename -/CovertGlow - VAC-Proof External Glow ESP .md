<hr>


**Looking for a simple glow ESP that’s undetected by VAC?**  

**HOW TO USE**  
1. Open CS:GO.  
2. Run the EXE.  
3. Enjoy glow (blue for CT, yellow for T).  

**VAC UNDETECTED**  
- Uses deep function and .text section obfuscation—assembly changes every run.  
- No consistent signatures = no VAC detection.  
- Even if flagged, no identifiable patterns remain.  

**TROUBLESHOOTING**  
- Run as admin.  
- Disable Windows Real-Time Protection (may block the cheat).  
- Ensure CS:GO is up to date.
